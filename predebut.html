		<p class="deb"> On December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment announced that they would debut a new girl group in the first half of 2014, which was supposed to be 
		<a href="https://twice.fandom.com/wiki/6mix" target="_blank">6mix</a>. 
		On February 27, 2014, JYP trainees Lena and Cecilia were confirmed as members of the group, while other rumored members included JYP trainees 
		<a href="nayeon.html" target="nav" class="nyp">Nayeon</a>, <a href="jeongyeon.html" target="nav" class="jyp">Jeongyeon</a>, 
		<a href="jihyo.html" target="nav" class="jhp">Jihyo</a> and Minyoung. 
		After Cecilia's departure, JYP trainee Sana replaced her and 6mix was about to debut when Lena left the company, effectively canceling their debut. </p>

		<p class="deb"> On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced that the lineup of JYP's upcoming seven member girl group would be decided through Sixteen, 
		a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. The show began on May 5 and ended with <a href="nayeon.html" target="nav">Nayeon</a>, 
		<a href="sana.html" target="nav" class="snp">Sana</a>, <a href="dahyun.html" target="nav" class="dhp">Dahyun</a>, 
		<a href="chaeyoung.html" target="nav" class="chp">Chaeyoung</a>, <a href="mina.html" target="nav" class="mnp">Mina</a>, 
		<a href="jihyo.html" target="nav" class="jhp">Jihyo</a>, and <a href="jeongyeon.html" target="nav" class="jyp">Jeongyeon</a> 
		as the seven Twice members. JYP then announced that he would be increasing the size of the group from 7 members to 9 by adding 
		<a href="tzuyu.html" target="nav" class="tzp">Tzuyu</a>, who was the "audience's pick" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, 
		and <a href="momo.html" target="nav" class="mmp">Momo</a>, who was added by JYP himself 
		since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time with many people complaining about 
		eliminated contestants being able to join the group. Twice was to debut in late 2015. </p>
